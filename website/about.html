                    as well as the main actor in the security tasks, such as implementing and maintaining security policies and tools,

                    <br>
                    I frequently do sysAdmin stuff like installing and maintaining infraestructure tools such as GitLab, Nfsen-ng, Wazuh, among others.

                <p class="article-text">
                    At UFPR, I'm currently on my 5th semester, where I'm studying: 
                    Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Software Design, Web Development and Algorithm Optimization.<br>
                    <br>
                    I also participated in a project called "PET Computação" which is a group of scholarship students that work on projects that help the community and the university lead by a professor.
                    There, was where I learned part of my sysAdmin skills and how to work in a team. My first task was to configure the local network of the lab including its firewall.
